       <p>We invite papers describing system demonstrations to be displayed at NAACL
HLT 2016 in San Diego. Submissions may range from early prototypes to mature production-ready
systems. Of particular interest are publicly available open-source or open-access systems.
All accepted demos are published in a companion volume of the
conference proceedings, and will be presented during a demo session at
	  NAACL with an accompanying poster.</p>


<h3 id="areas">Areas of Interest</h3>

<p>Areas of interest may include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>End-to-end systems
    <ul>
      <li>Information extraction and question answering </li>
      <li>Information access or dialogue </li>
      <li>Machine translation for consumer or industry applications</li>
      <li>Mobile applications</li>
      <li>NLP and speech technologies to support accessibility and assistive devices</li>
      <li>Technologies for the digital humanities</li>
      <li>Programs to automate linguistic analyses</a>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Systems aiding research and development in NLP
    <ul>
      <li>Interfaces and resources to support linguistic annotation</li>
      <li>Software architectures and reusable components</li>
      <li>Software tools for evaluation or error analysis</li>
      <li>Research toolkits implementing new or existing techniques</li>
      <li>Tools for data visualization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Systems supporting learning or education
    <ul>
      <li>Visual interactive aids for students</li>
      <li>Tutorial agents to support real-time feedback for learning</li>
      <li>Instructional aids for topics in computational linguistics</li>
      <li>Systems to score or critique textual student responses</li>
      <li>Systems to mine textual or behavioral data for educational purposes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Papers will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to
computational linguistics, innovation, and scientific contribution. Accepted submissions will be published in the
Companion Volume to the Proceedings of the Conference. As such, papers
will also be evaluated on writing style and clarity of
presentation.</p>

<p> Further details on the date, time, and format of the demonstration
session(s) will be determined soon.</p>


<h3 id="submission">Format for Submission</h3>

<p>Please use the main NAACL paper style (<a
href="http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs">http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs</a>)
and submission guidelines. Submissions  should include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The paper describing the motivation and technical details of the
  system, as well as a "script outline" of the demo presentation, consisting of an
  accompanying narrative and visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or
  diagrams). See examples of recent accepted demo papers in <a
  href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/#4000">ACL 2015</a>, <a
  href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N15/#3000">NAACL 2015</a>, <a
  href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P14/#5000">ACL 2014</a>, <a
  href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P13/#4000">ACL 2013</a>, and <a
  href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N13/#3000">NAACL 2013</a>.
  
  <li>A short (~2 minute) screencast video demonstrating the
  system. This screencast will be used to evaluate the paper, but won't
  be published unless requested.
</ol>

<p>As the reviewing will be blind, proposals must not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Do not include a URL to your
system if it reveals authorship, and remove all identifying
information from the screencast and any screenshots. In addition, please do not post your papers online until after the review process is complete.</p>

<p>The entire paper must not be more than four pages, with one optional
extra page for references. We will reject without review any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines, anonymity conditions and page limits. </p>

<p>Papers must be submitted electronically by February 5, 2016.</p>

<h3 id="dates">Important Dates</h3>

<p>All times are 11:59pm PST on the deadline day</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submission deadline: February 12, 2016</li>
  <li>Notification of acceptance: March 18, 2016</li>
