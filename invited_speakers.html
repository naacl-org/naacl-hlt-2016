                        Ehud Reiter is a Professor of Computing Science at the University
                        of Aberdeen and also Chief Scientist of Arria NLG.  He has worked on
                        natural language generation for the past 30 years, on methodology
                        (including evaluation) and resources as well as algorithms, and is
                        one of the most cited authors in NLG.  His 2000 book Building Natural
                        Language Generation Systems is widely used as an NLG textbook.  Dr Reiter
                        currently spends most of his time trying to commercialise NLG at Arria
                        (one of the largest specialist NLG companies), which grew out of a startup
                        he cofounded in 2009.

                  <p><b>Talk abstract:</b></p>
                  <p> Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems have different characteristics
                  than other NLP systems, which effects how they are evaluated. In particular,
                  it can be difficult to meaningfully evaluate NLG texts by comparing them against
                  gold-standard reference texts, because (A) there are usually many possible texts
                  which are acceptable to users and (B) some NLG systems produce texts which are better
                  (as judged by human users) than human-written corpus texts.  Partially because of
                  these reasons, the NLG community places much more emphasis on human-based
                  evaluations than most areas of NLP.
                  </p>
                  <p> I will discuss the various ways in which NLG systems are evaluated, focusing on
                  human-based evaluations.  These typically either measure the success of generated texts
                  at achieving a goal (eg, measuring how many people change their behaviour after reading
                  behaviour-change texts produced by an NLG system); or ask human subjects to rate various
                  aspects of generated texts (such as readability, accuracy, and appropriateness),
                  often on Likert scales.  I will use examples from evaluations I have carried out,
                  and highlight some of the lessons I have learnt, including the importance of reporting
                  negative results, the difference between laboratory and real-world evaluations, and
                  the need to look at worse-case as well as average-case performance.  I hope my talk will
                  be interesting and relevant to anyone who is interested in the evaluation of NLP systems.
