              <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) is an interdisciplinary research area that combines first-order logic and machine learning methods for probabilistic inference. Although many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (including text classification, semantic parsing, information extraction, coreference resolution, and sentiment analysis) can be formulated as inference in a first-order logic, most probabilistic first-order logics are not efficient enough to be used for large-scale versions of these tasks. In this tutorial, we provide a gentle introduction to the theoretical foundation of probabilistic logics, as well as their applications in NLP. We describe recent advances in designing scalable probabilistic logics, with a special focus on ProPPR. Finally, we provide a hands-on demo about scalable probabilistic logic programming for solving practical NLP problems.</p>

    <p><b>Outline:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><h5>Part 1: Foundations and Applications of Probabilistic First-Order Logic</h5>
  <p class="list-group-item-text">
  We will provide a brief review of some first-order learning systems that have been developed in the past: Markov Logic Networks (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), Stochastic Logic Programs (Muggleton, 1996). In this part, we introduce the semantics of the above languages with their inference (and learning) approaches. We analyze and discuss the core ideas behind of such language. We show various applications of probabilistic logics in NLP.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><h5>Part 2: Scalable Probabilistic Logics: A Case Study of ProPPR.</h5>
  <p class="list-group-item-text">
  We will focus on the efficiency issue, and introduce recent advances of scalable probabilistic logics, including lifted inference techniques (Van den Broeck and Suciu, 2014) and probabilistic soft logic (Bach et al., 2015). In particular, we will take CMU's ProPPR (Wang et al., 2013) as a case study. We describe the main contributions of ProPPR: including its approximate personalized PageRank inference scheme, parallel stochastic gradient descent learning method, and its flexibility in theory engineering. We then introduce the structure learning methods in ProPPR (Wang et al., CIKM 2014), including a structured regularization method as an alternative to predicate invention (Wang et al., IJCAI 2015). We will also cover our latest attempt of learning first-order logic formula embeddings, and discuss its relationship to (and possible connections between) even newer approaches to modeling knowledge bases, relationships, and inference using deep learning methods. To conclude this part, we show an interesting application of ProPPR (Wang et al., ACL-IJCNLP 2015): a joint information extraction and knowledge reasoning engine.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><h5>Part 3: Demos and Practical Applications.</h5>
  <p class="list-group-item-text">
  We switch from the theoretical presentations to an interactive demonstration session: we aim at providing a hands-on lab session to transfer the theories of scalable probabilistic logics into practices. More specifically, we will provide a demo of several applications on synthetic and real-world datasets. Participants are encouraged to check out our repository on Github (<a href="https://github.com/TeamCohen/ProPPR">https://github.com/TeamCohen/ProPPR</a>) and bring laptops to the tutorial. The list of demo examples to be considered are text categorization, entity resolution, knowledge base completion (Wang et al., MLJ 2015), dependency parsing (Wang et al., EMNLP 2014), structure learning, and joint information extraction & reasoning.
