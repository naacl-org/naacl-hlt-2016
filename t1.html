                <p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in interest in
semantically-informed natural language processing, including parsing
into semantic representations, grounded language processing that
connects linguistic structures to world representations, proposals to
integrate compositional and distributional approaches to semantics,
and approaches to semantically-sensitive tasks including sentiment
analysis, summarization, generation, machine translation, and
information extraction which take into account linguistic structure
beyond n-grams. The semantic inputs to this work include a wide range
of representations, from word embeddings, to syntactic dependencies
used as a proxy for semantic dependencies, to sentence-level semantic
representations either partial (e.g. semantic role labels) or fully
articulated.

<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to make accessible an important
resource in this space, namely the semantic representations produced
by the English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger 2000, 2011). The ERG
is a broad-coverage, linguistically motivated precision grammar for
English, associating richly detailed semantic representations with
input sentences.  These representations, dubbed English Resource
Semantics or ERS, are in the formalism of Minimal Recursion Semantics
(MRS; Copestake et al 2005).  They include not only semantic roles,
but also information about the scope of quantifiers and scopal
operators including negation, as well as semantic representations of
linguistically complex phenomena such as time and date expressions,
conditionals, and comparatives (Flickinger et al, 2014).  ERS
can be expressed in various ways, including a logic-based syntax using
predicates and arguments, dependency graphs and dependency triples.
In addition, the representations can be obtained either from existing
manually produced annotations over texts from a variety of genres (the
Redwoods Treebank, Oepen et al 2004) and DeepBank (Wall Street
Journal corpus: Flickinger et al 2012) or by processing new text
with the ERG and its associated parsing and parse selection
algorithms.  

<p>With high parsing accuracy with rich semantic representations, English
Resource Semantics is a valuable source of information for many
semantically-sensitive NLP tasks. ERS-based systems have achieved
state-of-the-art results in various tasks, including the
identification of speculative or negated event mentions in biomedical
text (MacKinlay et al 2011), question generation (Yao et al 2012),
detecting the scope of negation (Packard et al 2014), relating natural
language to robot control language (Packard 2014), and recognizing
textual entailment (PETE task; Lien & Kouylekov 2015).  ERS
representations have also been beneficial in semantic transfer-based
MT (Oepen et al 2007, Bond et al 2011), ontology acquisition (Herbelot
2006), extraction of glossary sentences (Reiplinger et al 2012),
sentiment analysis (Kramer & Gordon 2014), and the ACL Anthology
Searchbench (Sch&auml;fer et al 2011).

<p>The goal of this tutorial is to make this resource more accessible to
the ACL community.  Specifically, we take as our learning goals that
tutorial participants will learn how to: (1) set up the ERG-based
parsing stack, including preprocessing; (2) access ERG
Redwoods/DeepBank treebanks in the various export formats; and (3)
interpret ERS representations.

<p><b>About the Instructors</b></p>

<p>Dan Flickinger, Stanford University, danf@stanford.edu,

<p>Dan Flickinger is a Senior Research Associate at CSLI at Stanford, and manager of the Linguistic Grammars Online (LinGO) Laboratory, where he is the principal developer of the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG), a precise broad-coverage implementation of HPSG.  His primary research interests are in wide-coverage grammar engineering for both parsing and generation, lexical representation, the syntax-semantics interface, methodology for evaluation of semantically precise grammars, and practical applications of 'deep' processing. Applied and industrial experience includes co-founding the software company YY Technologies, which from 2000-2002 sold automated consumer email response technology incorporating the ERG; and since 2009 developing online educational software using the ERG for teaching English writing skills, first as part of the Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY) at Stanford, and for the past three years as a senior researcher at the EPGY spin-off company Redbird Advanced Learning, based in Oakland, California.

<p>Emily M. Bender is a Professor in the Department of
Linguistics and Associate Professor in the Department of Computer
Science & Engineering at the University of Washington.  Her primary
research interests lie in multilingual grammar engineering, semantic
representations, and the incorporation of linguistic knowledge,
especially from semantics and linguistic typology, in computational
linguistics.  She is the primary developer of the Grammar Matrix
grammar customization system, which is developed in the context of the
DELPH-IN Consortium (Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG
Initiative). Her book, <i>Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural
  Language Processing: 100 Essentials from Morphology and Syntax</i> grew
out of a NAACL 2012 tutorial on that topic.

<p>Woodley Packard is a student at the University of Washington, pursuing
a PhD in Computational Linguistics with Emily M. Bender.  His research
interests include efficient algorithms for grammar-based parsing,
generation, annotation, and learning; robustness mechanisms for
precision grammars; methodologies for contextually-informed
disambiguation; and applications of semantic representations.  He
wrote and maintains the ACE parser/generator and the FFTB annotation
tool.  Recent work includes designing and building the top-performing

commands to robots.</p>
