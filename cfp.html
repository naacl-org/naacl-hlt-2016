<h3>Submissions</h3>
<b>Long Papers</b>
<p>NAACL HLT 2016 long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and previously unpublished work. The long paper deadline is January 6, 2016 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8). Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.</p>
<p>Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references. Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages with unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.</p>
<p>Papers will be presented orally or as a poster presentation as determined by the program committee. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and those presented as poster presentations.</p>
<b>Short Papers</b>
<p>NAACL HLT 2016 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original, completed and previously unpublished work. The short paper deadline this year is also January 6, 2016 by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8). Types of short papers include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A small, focused contribution</li>
  <li>A negative result</li>
  <li>An opinion piece</li>
  <li>An interesting application nugget</li>
</ul>
<p>Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their final versions.</p>
<p>Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.</p>

<b>Electronic Submission</b>
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically using the Softconf START conference management system at the following URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softconf.com/naacl2016/papers">https://www.softconf.com/naacl2016/papers</a></p>
<p>The site will be open for accepting submissions one month before the conference deadline.</p>

<b>Format</b>
<p>Long paper and short paper submissions should follow the two-column format of NAACL HLT 2015 proceedings, where long papers should not exceed eight (8) pages of and short papers should not exceed four (4) pages of content. Page limits must be strictly observed.</p>

<p>Submissions should use the ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year’s conference; these style files are available for download from:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/">http://naacl.org/naacl-pubs/</a></li></ul>
<p>Even if you’ve submitted to NAACL before, please read the guidelines regarding grayscale readability. NAACL is enforcing grayscale readability of all figure and graphics as an aid to the color-blind and to those reading papers printed on B&W printers. Please check to make sure that all figures and graphics in this paper interpretable.</p>

<b>Double-blind Review Process</b>
<p>As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until after the review process is complete (in special cases this is permitted: see the multiple submission policy below).</p>

<p>We will reject without review any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines, anonymity conditions and page limits.</p>

<b>Multiple Submission Policy</b>
<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2016 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.</p>

<p>Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL HLT must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results. Authors should not submit short and long versions of papers with substantial overlap in their original contributions.</p>

<b>What is Considered “Unpublished Work”?</b>
<p>All prior peer-reviewed publications, either at a conference or workshop, are considered published prior work. Preprints such as those on <a href="arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a> and technical reports that are not peer reviewed are not considered prior published work for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The version submitted to NAACL HLT should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: “The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version.” Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.</p>
